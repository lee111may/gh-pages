I have chosen to study because I have a real passion for all things IT and figured it was time to challenge myself. 
I have been procrastinating for years about whether to take on a degree but due to the nature of my work role I wasn’t sure that I would be able to devote the time to a degree.</p>
  
<b>I am interested in IT because…</b><p>
I have had previous experience in upgrading and repairing PC’s, building PC’s from scratch and fixing family and friends PC’s for years. Programming took my interest, mainly by accident through a work colleague who fascinated me with his VBA programming skills.
I started learning through him and reading and understanding the code and how things worked until I could build my own macros confidently and create some okay programs with forms for work purposes. The ever changing fast evolving world of IT always keeps me wanting more and knowing more.</p> 

<b>What makes IT interesting for me?</b>  
<p>The fact that I know how to do things that others can’t do, yet also being aware that there are far more people out there that know far more than I do. I have an appetite for learning all things IT and with so many people out there that I can learn from makes it exciting and interesting. There are so many aspects to IT that it makes it difficult for me to pinpoint any one area that interests me. I would have to say though, at this stage it is programming that has my attention. It is indeed like trying to learn a foreign language in a foreign country, but the challenge is worthwhile once you manage to develop some working programs and realise that it’s starting to come together.</p>

<b>What led me to study at RMIT?</b>
<p>My career has taken me to a place where I no longer enjoy doing what I do, I do it because I know it and I am good at it however the passion and enthusiasm that I once had has all but gone. As I mentioned above, my passion has always been IT but until now, I have not had the confidence to undergo a degree. I am at a time in my life where I feel I can devote the time required and hopefully end up with a change in career at the end of it all.</p>
  
<b>What do I hope to do after graduation?</b>
<p>I would like to either work in application development or anything to do with network setups. Either way, I would be happy plugging away at code in front of a screen for a living or going from place to place setting up networks. The end result of both would be gratifying to know that I have made a difference and solved a problem for someone or some company.</p>
