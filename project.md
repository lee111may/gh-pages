<h1>Recipe generator</h1>
<p>My project would be an application that asks information from a user such as any allergies, age, weight etc.
A user would typically enter the required information and enter in current food ingredients found in the users fridge or cupboards. The application will search online for words that the user has input and then calculate the proportionate amount of ingredients required to prepare a meal. Based on the age weight allergies supplied by the user, it will then provide a selection of recipes that could be cooked by the user based on what ingredients have been supplied to the application.</p>
<p>I believe that the application will be useful for people with little time to go shopping after a busy day and would just like to prepare something from what they already have on hand. The idea of minimising food waste by having the app calculate exactly how much food will be required for the recipe is appealing as Australia currently wastes four million tonnes of food every year.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This equates to 345kg per household or in a financial term $8 billion – EVERY YEAR.</li>
  <li>Up to 40% of the average household bin is food waste which is costing them $1036 per year.</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Description of the application</h1>
<p>Application will ask user to select how many people will be eating. It will then ask information about each person so it can accurately calculate how much food should be purchased or used from the pantry.<br>
Once the personal information has been entered, the user will select food items found in their own pantry or fridge from a selection list on the application. If the application does not have something the user has then it will allow a text entry field to be submitted.
It will then search through online food recipes and food websites looking for an exact match of the ingredients supplied by the user. If an exact match cannot be found, it will then offer alternative recipes with either additional ingredients or less ingredients.</p>
<p>The user can select from a number of recipes which will be sorted by region of ethnicity – Indian, Italian, French, Western etc. Each time a recipe is selected by the user, the application will save that recipe against the users profile. Once the recipe has been prepared and the meal has been completed, the application will ask for a rating of the meal. This rating will be used to offer future suggestions based on how many times the user has cooked a particular recipe from the past or it will offer suggestions on food the user has previously cooked and liked but not had for a while.</p>
<p>The application can also have a shopping list that can be added to each time a user has used an ingredient. It will calculate how much food to add to the shopping list by looking up the database of ingredients previously used and averaging it by how many people have been cooked for.</p>
<p>For a family of four the ingredients should would not be likely to vary too much week on week. The profile of family members can be updated as kids either get older and burn through more food or even if Mum and Dad decide that they need to go on a diet. The amount of calories that can be selected for consumption per day can be enough to generate a meal plan for each day if required also.
The application will adjust the food ingredients required depending on how many calories the user has selected for each member of the family.</p>
<p>If the user is on a diet, the application could also search for recipes that are low in fatty ingredients / sugars etcetera and give the user another alternative.</p>
<p>With measured ingredients every time a family requires a recipe this will go a long way toward food waste and will even benefit the family household budget by over $1,000 per year.
This would be enough money to feed the family for a month and also help reduce the household food waste from 20% down to (hopefully zero).</p>
<p>Even if the waste was reduced by a third through use of the application, it would be a significant benefit to not only the household but also the environment and ultimately have food sustainability for our future.</p>
<h1>Tools and Technology</h1>
<p>All that would be required would be a mobile phone or tablet or even a P.C. The application could be either Apple or Android and even reside as a website.
Software and hardware required would be a backend database residing on a server or even if the user wanted local information only without logging into the internet, the information could be saved on their own device and refreshed as required by connecting to the database for recipe updates.</p>
<p>Github could be used to develop the website and free open source databases like MongoDB and Maria DB or even PostgreSQL. There are many others that can be found online through a simple Google search.</p>

<h1>Skills required for the project</h1>
<p>HTML web development and mobile application development would be required. Github for the Web platform and something also like MIT app development tools. This could be achieved without too much of a high-level skill set. The database integration into both the website and mobile application would be something perplexing but not out of the question for the right team member. There is a lot of help out there and with the right amount of knowledge and the right team this could work.</p>

<h1>Success of the project</h1>
<p>If the project becomes successful the impact would be enormous to humanity. The food waste that goes on in Australia alone is enough to make you stop and think how much of a wasteful society we have become. Surely this is not sustainable and sooner or later there will be a worldwide food crisis. If we act now and do something before it gets out of control, then it will greatly benefit all those future generations yet to come after us. I struggle to understand how people can be starving on one side of the planet and yet on the other side of the planet we are throwing out enough to feed them all. It just seems unbalanced and if there is a technological advancement to eliminate or minimise the waste then this could be it.</p>
