<b>Personal Information:</b><br>

Background: New Zealand born Australian Citizen, my education to date is limited.<br> 
<p>Previous studies at TAFE, diploma of management various other training courses (mainly work stuff). 
I would have to say that life experience has been my constant teacher to date. I have worked from the ground up in my early years to a senior role in management over my career. 
I have an interest in golf, motorcycles and in my spare time I also like to sketch and airbrush.<br>
My favourite sport would be hands down <a href="http://www.motogp.com/"><b>MOTO GP.</b></a></p>

<b>What i expect to learn during my studies?</b>
<p>So far, I have already learned more than I could have thought possible in such a short amount of time. My programming knowledge of Java has developed rather quickly and I’m extremely excited to continue learning not only Java but all other areas too. I don’t expect to become a fully-fledged developer overnight without the hard work and screen time but I do expect that I will know enough to begin my journey confidently and grow from there.</p>
