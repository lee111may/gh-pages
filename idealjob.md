<h3>Description of Job</h3>

<p>•	Design & build innovative mobile apps
•	Immediate start available
•	Permanent role based in Maroochydore on the Sunshine Coast
Build out mobile applications on Android and iOS and maintain and develop on going features in Maroochydore.</p>

<p>Your new company</p>
<p>Our client is an industry specific specialist whose innovative & patented management capability maximises productivity and improves service quality. Their applications and software solutions enables their customers to view and control their operations in real-time, delivering insights and benchmarks and streamlining performance.</p>

<p>Your new role</p>
<p>As a Mobile Applications Developer you will be responsible for building out mobile applications on both Android and iOS as well as maintaining and developing on going features. Coordinating with the rest of the team, a commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and quality product is essential.</p>

<p>What you'll need to succeed</p>
<p>• Design and Build innovative, intuitive and responsive hybrid web application and native app.
• Coding, packaging and deployment, as well as monitoring the app performance and stability.
• Ensure the performance, quality, and responsiveness of applications
• Collaborate with a team to define, design, and ship new features
• Investigate issues reported by their teams, determine impact and root cause, and solve them.
• Identify and correct bottlenecks and fix bugs to optimise performance.
• Help maintain code quality, organisation, and automatization</p>

<p>Requirements Skills/Experience:</p>

<p>• Practical knowledge of Objective C, Swift, and Java
• 2+ years of experience in Android
• 2+ years of experience in iOS development
• High attention to detail and a knack for making a mobile experience beautiful
• Working knowledge of React Native</p>

<p>Ability to create intuitive, testable, maintainable and efficient code</p>

<p>• Experience with UI layout designing and UX fundamentals
• Experience writing tests and refactoring.
• A deep understanding of the importance of building maintainable, efficient, clean code.
• Experience with analytics and performance monitoring SDK’s - Crashlytics
• Excellent English communication skills, both verbal and written
• You should have knowledge in Web Services / REST API's / JSON Parsing
• Strong object oriented programming skills and understanding of MVC pattern and MVP</p>


<p>•	A mobile applications developer required for building and maintaining mobile apps for both IOS and Android. The position is appealing to me because there are lots of problem solving techniques required for day to day activity. It is based on the Sunshine Coast (Qld) and requires experience in not only Java but Objective C and other languages.</p>
<p>•	While the skills and qualifications (Java, C , Swift and react native) are far away from where my knowledge currently resides, I still have a number of years to go to complete this degree. I am confident that I can learn and perhaps seek work experience in a development environment to obtain the skills and background / team experience required to fulfil the role.</p>
<p>•	The IT experience that I currently possess is limited Java programming knowledge and VBA knowledge. I have a good understanding of computers and how they work and have a good understanding of the hardware side of things. I have managed large teams and large businesses and believe that I could be of benefit to any organisation.</p>
<p>•	Although I lack the skills required for this position, I plan to complete my next subject (programming 1) and seek to get work experience with current developers. I am fortunate enough to know quite a few people in the IT industry and am confident that I can get more experience with the assistance of them. This will help me to stay on track and ensure that I develop the area of skill I currently lack knowledge in.</p>
