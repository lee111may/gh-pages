<p><u>My take of the job advertisement</u></p>
<p>•	A mobile applications developer required for building and maintaining mobile apps for both IOS and Android. The position is appealing to me because there are lots of problem solving techniques required for day to day activity. It is based on the Sunshine Coast (Qld) and requires experience in not only Java but Objective C and other languages.</p>
<p>•	While the skills and qualifications (Java, C , Swift and react native) are far away from where my knowledge currently resides, I still have a number of years to go to complete this degree. I am confident that I can learn and perhaps seek work experience in a development environment to obtain the skills and background / team experience required to fulfil the role.</p>
<p>•	The IT experience that I currently possess is limited Java programming knowledge and VBA knowledge. I have a good understanding of computers and how they work and have a good understanding of the hardware side of things. I have managed large teams and large businesses and believe that I could be of benefit to any organisation.</p>
<p>•	Although I lack the skills required for this position, I plan to complete my next subject (programming 1) and seek to get work experience with current developers. I am fortunate enough to know quite a few people in the IT industry and am confident that I can get more experience with the assistance of them. This will help me to stay on track and ensure that I develop the area of skill I currently lack knowledge in.</p>
